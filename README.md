# Traffic_Light_FSM
This project develops a 4-state Moore Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog to control traffic lights (NS_GREEN, NS_YELLOW, EW_GREEN, EW_YELLOW) with 10 and 3 clock cycle timings, verified using a UVM testbench in SystemVerilog. Simulated on EDA Playground with Riviera-PRO, it ensures safe transitions and 100% state coverage.
